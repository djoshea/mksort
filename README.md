MKsort
======

It's a heck of a spikesorter.

This software, MKsort, allows users to import electrophysiology data and 
classify waveforms as coming from different units ("sort spikes"). It
also provides tools for examining the stability of these isolations over
time, rating the isolations, measuring spike widths, and examining the
functional tuning of the sorted units.
